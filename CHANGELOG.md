## [2025-10-11] - Real ML Dashboard with Actual Algorithms

### Added

**New Real ML Dashboard** (`src/anomaly_detection/dash/real_ml_dashboard.py`):
- Uses ACTUAL Matrix Profile algorithm (STUMPY library) for BGP anomaly detection
- Uses ACTUAL Isolation Forest algorithm (scikit-learn, 150 trees) for SNMP anomaly detection
- Loads pre-trained Isolation Forest model from `data/models/isolation_forest_model_tuned.pkl`
- Falls back to training new model with 250 synthetic samples if pre-trained not found
- Displays genuine confidence scores and detection decisions from ML algorithms
- Shows authentic processing delays (2-5 seconds per bin, 30-60s for detection)
- Real-time Matrix Profile distance calculation with 2.5σ threshold
- True Isolation Forest outlier scoring in high-dimensional feature space
- Genuine algorithm output: not simulated or mocked
- Badge indicator showing "REAL ALGORITHMS" to distinguish from simulated version

**Real ML Processing**:
- Matrix Profile: Maintains sliding window, computes pairwise distances, identifies discords
- Isolation Forest: Builds 150 isolation trees, computes anomaly scores, detects outliers
- BGP features: withdrawals, announcements, AS-path churn processed as time-series
- SNMP features: CPU, memory, temperature, interface metrics in 8-dimensional space

- Current: Two dashboard versions:
  1. `modern_dashboard.py` - Simulated (fast, demo-friendly)
  2. `real_ml_dashboard.py` - Real ML (authentic, educational)

**Detection methodology**:
- Simulated: `is_anomaly = scenario == "BGP" and i < 2` (hardcoded)
- Real ML: `is_anomaly = bgp_detector.update(feature_bin)["is_anomaly"]` (algorithm decision)

**Confidence scores**:
- Simulated: `confidence = np.random.uniform(0.7, 0.95)` (random)
- Real ML: `confidence = bgp_result["anomaly_confidence"]` (computed from algorithm)

### Technical Details

- Library: STUMPY (stumpy.stump for CPU computation)
- Window: 64 bins (32 minutes)
- Threshold: 2.5 standard deviations
- Series: wdr_total, ann_total, as_path_churn
- Method: Pairwise distance computation to find discords
- Output: min_distance, is_anomaly, detected_series, confidence

- Library: scikit-learn IsolationForest
- Trees: 150 estimators
- Features: 8 SNMP metrics (cpu_mean, cpu_max, mem_mean, mem_max, temp_mean, temp_max, if_error, if_util)
- Contamination: 2% (expected anomaly rate)
- Method: Path length in isolation trees
- Output: is_anomaly, confidence, anomaly_score, affected_features, severity

**Performance Characteristics**:

Reorganized simulators into the proper package structure. The project now has a cleaner, more focused structure with proper separation of concerns.

### Removed - Status Report Documents

**Deleted 9 files** that were statements of work done rather than useful documentation:

- `FINAL_PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Project status summary
- `MULTIMODAL_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary
- `README_MULTIMODAL.md` - Redundant multimodal overview
- `QUICK_START_MULTIMODAL.md` - Redundant quick start (content preserved in docs/MULTIMODAL_CORRELATION.md)
- `src/anomaly_detection/ORGANIZATION.md` - Src directory summary (content preserved in src/anomaly_detection/README.md)
- `data/evaluation/REAL_METRICS_SUMMARY.md` - Evaluation status report
- `docs/development/thesis.md` - Minimal thesis description
- `docs/development/proposal.md` - Empty file
- `docs/development/evaulation_plan.md` - Duplicate with typo
- `docs/development/program_alignment.md` - Empty file

### Removed - Temporary Test Scripts

**Deleted 5 files** from evaluation/ per project rules (temporary test harnesses should be deleted after use):

- `evaluation/debug_pipeline.py` - Debug harness
- `evaluation/test_feature_extraction.py` - Feature extraction test
- `evaluation/test_gpu.py` - GPU test harness
- `evaluation/test_stumpy_directly.py` - Stumpy test harness
- `evaluation/diagnose_isolation_forest.py` - Diagnostic script

**Note**: Proper tests are in `tests/` directory following pytest conventions.

### Moved - Simulator Scripts

**Moved 2 files** from evaluation/ to src package for proper organization:

- `evaluation/bgp_simulator.py` → `src/anomaly_detection/simulators/bgp_simulator.py`
- `evaluation/snmp_baseline.py` → `src/anomaly_detection/simulators/snmp_baseline.py`

**Updated imports** in:

- `evaluation/run_evaluation.py`
- `evaluation/run_with_real_pipeline.py`
- `evaluation/ORGANIZATION.md`

## [2025-10-11] - Project-Wide Reorganization

### Summary 1

Comprehensive reorganization of project structure to remove lab environment references, standardize imports, organize tests with pytest conventions, add proper Python package structure, and add extensive documentation.

### Added - Python Package Structure

**Created**:

- `pyproject.toml` - Proper Python package configuration
  - Package name: `network-anomaly-detection`
  - All dependencies configured
  - Optional dependencies: dev, gpu, snmp
  - Pytest configuration included

**Installation**:

- Editable install: `pip install -e .`
- Enables clean imports from anywhere
- No more path manipulation hacks

**Removed from 14 files**:

- All `sys.path.insert()` statements
- 7 evaluation scripts cleaned
- 3 example scripts cleaned
- Conftest.py uses proper path setup

**Benefits**:

- Clean imports: `from src.models import MatrixProfileDetector`
- Works from any directory
- Better IDE support
- Standard Python practice

### Removed - Lab Environment (37+ files, ~1GB)

**Lab Infrastructure:**

- Deleted 6 shell scripts: `deploy.sh`, `destroy.sh`, `collector.sh`, `check-bgp.sh`, `inject-failures.sh`, `monitor-logs.sh`
- Deleted lab configs: `src/configs/lab_config.yml`, `evaluation/topology.yml`, `src/failure-injector/exabgp.conf`
- Deleted integration: `scripts/integrate-with-ml.py`, `evaluation/DECISION_LOG.md`
- Removed `src/venv/` directory (~1GB)
- Removed empty directories: `data/lab_traces/`, `data/public_traces/`, `evaluation/scenarios/`

**Stale Code:**

- Deleted `src/models/mslstm_baseline.py` (empty stub)

**Test Duplicates (21 files):**

- Removed test files duplicating evaluation/ functionality
- Removed obsolete runner scripts (.ps1, .sh)
- Removed mock/demo scripts

**Result**: Zero references to Containerlab, FRR, or ExaBGP in codebase
